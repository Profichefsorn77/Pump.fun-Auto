# Pump.fun-Auto
This script automates the process of creating and pumping a custom token on the Solana blockchain, while simulating market activity through pre-funded bot accounts. After the user funds their primary Solana wallet, the script will automatically disperse the funds across 20-40 unique wallets. These wallets will then use the Pump.fun API to create the token, participate in its market pump, and sell it before hitting a 90% price peak. The bot utilizes the Jito bundle technique for rapid transaction execution and automatically detects new liquidity pools on Raydium, ensuring the highest efficiency for token purchases and sales.
Process:

    Initial Wallet Funding: The user funds a primary Solana wallet with the desired amount of Solana (SOL). This wallet acts as the main source for dispersing funds across multiple wallets.

    Wallet Dispersal: Once the main wallet is funded, the script automatically splits the funds across 20-40 pre-configured wallets. This distribution ensures a broad presence in the market, mimicking large-scale trading activity and helping to create artificial liquidity for the user-defined token.

    Coin Creation & Launch: The user links their Pump.fun account and inputs the desired details for the custom token (such as name, symbol, etc.). One of the pre-funded bot accounts will then create the token on the Solana blockchain using the provided wallet.

    Pump Simulation: After the token is created, the bot accounts automatically begin buying and trading the token using the distributed wallets. The bot utilizes the Jito bundle technique, which allows it to execute transactions across all wallets within the same transaction block, optimizing speed and cost.

    Automated Pool Detection: The bot constantly monitors Raydium for new token pools and automatically purchases the token from newly created liquidity pools. This ensures that the bot takes advantage of fresh market opportunities.

    Transaction Execution via LUT (Lookup Table Address): All transactions are processed using a Lookup Table Address (LUT), which optimizes transaction execution on the Solana blockchain. Proper LUT configuration ensures that the buying and selling of tokens is efficient and smooth.

    Auto-Sell with Risk Management: The bot’s auto-sell functionality ensures that it sells the token before it reaches 90% of its peak price, protecting profits and mitigating risk. Users can customize take-profit options and stop-loss settings to align with their risk tolerance.

    Funds Transfer to User-Defined Address: After the sell orders are executed, the funds from all bot wallets are consolidated and sent to a Solana address provided by the user. This allows the user to easily access the profits from the pump simulation.

    Customizable Behavior: Users can adjust bot behavior through configurable environment variables, fine-tuning aspects like buy conditions, transaction speeds, and sniping behavior. The script also features advanced filters for precise control over how the bot identifies and acts on buying opportunities.


Features:

Pump.fun Token Launch Integration: The script seamlessly integrates with the Pump.fun API, allowing users to launch custom tokens with ease. This automation simplifies the token creation and launch process, giving users full control over the market entry.

Jito Bundle Technique for Efficient Transactions: By leveraging the Jito bundle technique, the bot ensures that token purchases are executed across 20 pre-funded wallets within the same transaction block. This enhances the speed and efficiency of the process, minimizing transaction costs and maximizing the impact of the pump.

LUT (Lookup Table Address) Configuration: The bot requires the configuration of a Lookup Table Address (LUT), optimizing transaction execution by using this address for processing token-related transactions. Proper LUT configuration ensures smooth and efficient execution of trades on the Solana blockchain.

Automated Pool Detection: The bot automatically detects new token pools on Raydium and triggers purchases without user intervention. This feature ensures that the bot remains agile, responding instantly to emerging liquidity opportunities.

Jito Integration for Rapid Transaction Processing: Integrated with the Jito block engine, the bot leverages this technology to ensure rapid and highly efficient transaction processing. This integration optimizes the purchase and sale of tokens, ensuring transactions are executed as quickly as possible within the same block.

Configurable Environment Variables: Users can customize the behavior of the bot through environment variables, allowing for greater flexibility in how the bot operates. Whether it's adjusting buy conditions, sell strategies, or transaction speeds, environment variables offer full control over bot performance.

Auto-Sell Functionality: The bot comes with built-in auto-sell functionality, which automates the selling process with multiple take-profit options and stop-loss settings. This ensures that the bot sells tokens based on pre-defined profit thresholds, protecting against significant losses and locking in gains.

Comment-Refresh: The bot will send a realistic looking new comment to the coin page every 1 second, until the sell orders are published.

Advanced Filters and Configuration: The script offers extensive filter options for sniping behavior, allowing users to fine-tune how the bot detects and acts on potential buying opportunities. These advanced filters enhance the precision of the bot’s actions, making it highly adaptable to varying market conditions.
