# Pump.fun-Auto 🚀

**Pump.fun-Auto** automates the process of creating and pumping a custom token on the Solana blockchain. It simulates market activity by utilizing pre-funded bot accounts. After funding their primary Solana wallet, the user can distribute the funds across 20-40 unique wallets. These wallets interact with the **Pump.fun API** to create the custom token, participate in its market pump, and sell it before reaching a 90% price peak. The script uses advanced techniques like the **Jito bundle** for rapid transaction execution. ⚡

## Process 📝

### 1. **Initial Wallet Funding** 💰
The user funds a primary Solana wallet with the desired amount of Solana (SOL). This wallet serves as the source for distributing funds across multiple wallets.

### 2. **Wallet Dispersal** 🔄
Once the main wallet is funded, the script automatically splits the funds across 20-40 pre-configured wallets. This distribution mimics large-scale trading activity, helping to create artificial liquidity for the **user-defined token**.

### 3. **Custom Token Creation & Launch** 🚀
The user specifies the parameters for their custom token (e.g., name, symbol, etc.). One of our pre-funded bot accounts will then create the token on the Solana blockchain using the provided wallet and parameters.

### 4. **Pump Simulation** 📈
Once the token is created, the bot accounts begin buying and trading the **user-defined token** across the distributed wallets. The bot uses the **Jito bundle technique**, executing transactions within the same block to optimize speed and cost.

### 5. **Token Market Pump** 📈
Once the token is created, the bot begins buying and trading only the user-defined token across the distributed wallets. The bot uses the **Jito bundle technique**, executing transactions within the same block to optimize speed and cost, ensuring a smooth and impactful market pump for the custom token.

### 6. **Transaction Execution via LUT (Lookup Table Address)** 🔒
Transactions are processed using a **Lookup Table Address (LUT)**, optimizing execution and ensuring smooth, efficient token buying and selling on the Solana blockchain for the custom token.

### 7. **Auto-Sell with Risk Management** 📉
The bot automatically sells the user-defined token before it reaches 90% of its peak price, protecting profits and mitigating risk. Users can customize take-profit and stop-loss options based on their risk tolerance.

### 8. **Funds Transfer to User-Defined Address** 💸
After sell orders are executed, the funds from all bot wallets are consolidated and transferred to the Solana address provided by the user. This simplifies access to the profits from the pump simulation.

### 9. **Customizable Behavior** ⚙️
Users can adjust the bot’s behavior through configurable environment variables. This allows fine-tuning of aspects like buy conditions, transaction speeds, and sniping behavior. The script also includes **advanced filters** for precise control over bot actions and buying opportunities.

## Features ✨

### **Pump.fun Token Launch Integration** 🔗
The script seamlessly creates and launches the user-defined custom token with the specified parameters, using one of our pre-funded bot accounts. This simplifies the token creation and launch process, giving users full control over market entry.

### **Jito Bundle Technique for Efficient Transactions** 🏎️
By utilizing the **Jito bundle technique**, the bot executes token purchases across 20 pre-funded wallets within the same transaction block. This boosts speed, reduces transaction costs, and maximizes the impact of the pump for the user-defined token.

### **LUT (Lookup Table Address) Configuration** 🛠️
Proper configuration of a **Lookup Table Address (LUT)** is required for optimizing transaction execution. This ensures smooth token trading and efficient use of the Solana blockchain for the custom token.

### **Token Market Pump** 🛒
The bot automatically buys and trades the **user-defined token** across distributed wallets, simulating a market pump. The bot ensures that the pump is targeted specifically at the created token, with the use of the **Jito bundle technique** to optimize speed and cost.

### **Jito Integration for Rapid Transaction Processing** ⚡
Integrated with the **Jito block engine**, the bot ensures rapid and efficient transaction processing, enabling quick execution of token purchases and sales within the same block for the custom token.

### **Configurable Environment Variables** 🔧
Users can customize bot behavior through environment variables, offering flexibility to adjust buy conditions, sell strategies, transaction speeds, and more. This ensures full control over bot performance.

### **Auto-Sell Functionality** 💼
The bot’s **auto-sell functionality** automates the selling process, with multiple take-profit and stop-loss options for the user-defined token. This helps secure profits and limit losses by adhering to pre-defined profit thresholds.

### **Comment-Refresh** 💬
The bot sends realistic-looking new comments to the coin page every second until the sell orders are executed, simulating natural market activity.

### **Advanced Filters and Configuration** 🔎
The script offers advanced filter options for sniping behavior, allowing users to fine-tune how the bot detects and acts on potential buying opportunities. These **advanced filters** enhance the bot’s precision and adaptability to varying market conditions.
