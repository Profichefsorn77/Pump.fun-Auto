# Pump.fun-Auto 🚀

**Pump.fun-Auto** automates the process of creating and pumping a custom token on the Solana blockchain. It simulates market activity by utilizing pre-funded bot accounts. After funding their primary Solana wallet, the user can distribute the funds across 20-40 unique wallets. These wallets interact with the **Pump.fun API** to create the token, participate in its market pump, and sell it before reaching a 90% price peak. The script uses advanced techniques like the **Jito bundle** for rapid transaction execution. ⚡

## Process 📝

### 1. **Initial Wallet Funding** 💰
The user funds a primary Solana wallet with the desired amount of Solana (SOL). This wallet serves as the source for distributing funds across multiple wallets.

### 2. **Wallet Dispersal** 🔄
Once the main wallet is funded, the script automatically splits the funds across 20-40 pre-configured wallets. This distribution mimics large-scale trading activity, helping to create artificial liquidity for the user-defined token.

### 3. **Coin Creation & Launch** 🚀
The user links their **Pump.fun** account and inputs the details for the custom token (e.g., name, symbol, etc.). A pre-funded bot account then creates the token on the Solana blockchain using the provided wallet.

### 4. **Pump Simulation** 📈
Once the token is created, the bot accounts begin buying and trading the token across the distributed wallets. The bot uses the **Jito bundle technique**, executing transactions within the same block to optimize speed and cost.

### 5. **Automated Pool Detection** 🔍
The bot continuously monitors for new token pools and automatically purchases tokens from newly created pools. This ensures the bot capitalizes on fresh market opportunities without delay.

### 6. **Transaction Execution via LUT (Lookup Table Address)** 🔒
Transactions are processed using a **Lookup Table Address (LUT)**, optimizing execution and ensuring smooth, efficient token buying and selling on the Solana blockchain.

### 7. **Auto-Sell with Risk Management** 📉
The bot automatically sells the token before reaching 90% of its peak price, protecting profits and mitigating risk. Users can customize take-profit and stop-loss options based on their risk tolerance.

### 8. **Funds Transfer to User-Defined Address** 💸
After sell orders are executed, the funds from all bot wallets are consolidated and transferred to the Solana address provided by the user. This simplifies access to the profits from the pump simulation.

### 9. **Customizable Behavior** ⚙️
Users can adjust the bot’s behavior through configurable environment variables. This allows fine-tuning of aspects like buy conditions, transaction speeds, and sniping behavior. The script also includes **advanced filters** for precise control over bot actions and buying opportunities.

## Features ✨

### **Pump.fun Token Launch Integration** 🔗
The script integrates seamlessly with the **Pump.fun API**, allowing users to launch custom tokens with ease. This simplifies the token creation and launch process, giving users full control over market entry.

### **Jito Bundle Technique for Efficient Transactions** 🏎️
By utilizing the **Jito bundle technique**, the bot executes token purchases across 20 pre-funded wallets within the same transaction block. This boosts speed, reduces transaction costs, and maximizes the impact of the pump.

### **LUT (Lookup Table Address) Configuration** 🛠️
Proper configuration of a **Lookup Table Address (LUT)** is required for optimizing transaction execution. This ensures smooth token trading and efficient use of the Solana blockchain.

### **Automated Pool Detection** 🛒
The bot automatically detects new token pools and purchases tokens from these newly created liquidity pools without user intervention. This ensures the bot is always ready to act on fresh market opportunities.

### **Jito Integration for Rapid Transaction Processing** ⚡
Integrated with the **Jito block engine**, the bot ensures rapid and efficient transaction processing, enabling quick execution of token purchases and sales within the same block.

### **Configurable Environment Variables** 🔧
Users can customize bot behavior through environment variables, offering flexibility to adjust buy conditions, sell strategies, transaction speeds, and more. This ensures full control over bot performance.

### **Auto-Sell Functionality** 💼
The bot’s **auto-sell functionality** automates the selling process, with multiple take-profit and stop-loss options. This helps secure profits and limit losses by adhering to pre-defined profit thresholds.

### **Comment-Refresh** 💬
The bot sends realistic-looking new comments to the coin page every second until the sell orders are executed, simulating natural market activity.

### **Advanced Filters and Configuration** 🔎
The script offers advanced filter options for sniping behavior, allowing users to fine-tune how the bot detects and acts on potential buying opportunities. These **advanced filters** enhance the bot’s precision and adaptability to varying market conditions.
